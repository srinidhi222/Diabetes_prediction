# Diabetes_prediction
This project involved developing a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset encompassing key physiological indicators, including glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI.
Key aspects of the project include:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset underwent rigorous preprocessing, including scaling numerical features using StandardScaler to ensure optimal model performance and prevent features with larger values from dominating the learning process.
Model Development: An SVM with a linear kernel was selected and trained on the preprocessed data. SVMs are powerful algorithms well-suited for classification tasks, and the linear kernel provides a balance of performance and interpretability.
Model Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric. It achieved a training accuracy of approximately 78.7% and a test accuracy of approximately 77.3%, demonstrating its ability to generalize to unseen data.
Predictive Capability: The trained model can predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on their health metrics. This has the potential to be a valuable tool for early detection and intervention.
This project showcases proficiency in machine learning workflows, including data handling, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment for making predictions. It demonstrates the ability to build and assess predictive models for real-world health applications.
